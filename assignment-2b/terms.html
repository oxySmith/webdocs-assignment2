            Cottbus Delivery GmbH Privacy Policy<br/><br/>

            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
            make a purchase from www.cottbus.delivery (the “Site”).<br/><br/>

            PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br/>

            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address,<br/> time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
            your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
            products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, <br/>and information about how
            you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
            Information.”<br/>

            We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br/>
            - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
            Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br/>
            - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
            the Site.<br/><br/>

            Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain
            information from you, including your name, billing address,<br/> shipping address, payment information (including
            credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order
            Information.”<br/><br/>

            When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
            Information and Order Information.<br/><br/>

            HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br/>

            We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site
            (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping,<br/> and providing you with invoices
            and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:<br/>
            Communicate with you;<br/>
            Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and<br/>
            When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
            relating to our products or services.<br/><br/>

            We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
            your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example,<br/> by generating analytics
            about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
            advertising campaigns).<br/><br/>

            SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br/>

            We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described
            above. We may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations<br/>, to
            respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
            protect our rights.<br/><br/>

            BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING<br/>
            As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or
            marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. <br/>For more information about how targeted
            advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at

            will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.<br/><br/>
