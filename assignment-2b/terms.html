        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

            <h3>Cottbus Delivery GmbH Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
                make a purchase from www.cottbus.delivery (the “Site”). 
            </p>
           

            <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
                information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
                your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
                products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how
                you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                Information.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
                - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
                Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
                the Site.

                Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain
                information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including
                credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order
                Information.”

                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
                Information and Order Information.
            </p>
            

            <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>
                We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site
                (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
                and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
                Communicate with you;
                Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
                relating to our products or services.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
                your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics
                about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
                advertising campaigns).
            </p>
            

            <h3>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

                When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and
                until you ask us to delete this information.
